## Welcome to the Bird Cafe GitHub website!

This is where you will be able to see all of the documentation, instructions and general discussions around this project. We Will keep this updated as releases are made so keep an eye out!

### What can you find here?

We will have different sections that cover all of the things you should need to benefit from this project. Since this is an open-source project, feel free to submit issues, fork our repository and make pull requests. There will be sections documenting our code so that if you want to make an edit, you can get coding as quickly as possible.

Having said that, if you are not as much of a programming enthusiast and just want to use our product to log your interactions with wildlife, this page will have you covered as well! There will be an instructions section which will walk you through how to install our code onto your Raspberry Pi and get it up and running. These instructions will include videos and images to help you no matter what your technical background is.
