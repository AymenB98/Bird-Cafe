# Bird-Cafe
This is the software for an autonomous bird feeder which will do the following: 
- release food when a bird lands on it.
- take a picture of the bird and upload it to a server on a Raspberri Pi. 
- use machine learning to make sure it was a bird that landed on the feeder, and not something else.

A GUI front end will also be created to allow a user to interact with the system easily.

This project is being completed for Real Time Embedded Programming 5 at the University of Glasgow by Aymen Benylles, Joe Costello, Alena Larionova and Jonathan Roarty.
