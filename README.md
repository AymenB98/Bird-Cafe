## Description
This is the software for an autonomous bird feeder which does the following:
- detect a bird landing on the feeder.
- take a picture of the bird and upload it to a server on a Raspberri Pi. 
- use machine learning to make sure it was a bird that landed on the feeder, and not something else.
- Tweet an image of the bird with a caption.

A GUI front end has also be created to allow a user to interact with the system easily.

This project is being completed for Real Time Embedded Programming 5 at the University of Glasgow by Aymen Benylles, Joe Costello, Alena Larionova and Jonathan Roarty.
